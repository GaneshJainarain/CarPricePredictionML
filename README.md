# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning



This dataset contains information about used cars.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

name
year
selling_price
km_driven
fuel
seller_type
transmission
Owner
## Reading our Data into a Pandas Dataframe
- Read our data into a pandas dataframe, with `.read_csv`
- Print out the head of our dataframe with `.head()`
- Observe the shape of our dataframe with `.shape`
```python
pip install pandas 
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('env/Code/cardata.csv')
print("First Five Instances of our Dataframe:")
print(df.head())
print("Shape of Our Dataframe:")
print(df.shape)
```

## Observing our Dataframe
As we can see from the output of df.shape and df.head()
we have 301 rows of data and 9 features denoted by (301, 9)
Our 9 features include:
- Car_Name
- Year
- Selling_Price
- Present_Price
- Kms_Driven
- Fuel_Type
- Seller_Type
- Transmission
- Owner

We can also observe that one feature is our output feature or `Dependent Feature` which in this case is `Selling Price`, this feature is dependent on the other independent features such as Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type etc, this feature 'Selling Price' is also the feature we are trying to predict or find.

### Categorical Features

Categorical data is non-numeric and often can be characterized into categories or groups. A simple example is color; red, blue, and yellow are all distinct colors.
We encode categorical data numerically because math is generally done using numbers. 

A big part of natural language processing is converting text to numbers. Just like that, our algorithms cannot run and process data if that data is not numerical. Therefore, data scientists need to have tools at their disposal to transform colors like red, yellow, and blue into numbers like 1, 2, and 3 for all the backend math to take place. 

    - One Hot Encoding 
    One-hot encoding is a method of identifying whether a unique categorical value from a categorical feature is present or not. What I mean by this is that if our feature is primary color (and each row has only one primary color), one-hot encoding would represent whether the color present in each row is red, blue, or yellow. 

    This is accomplished by adding a new column for each possible color. With these three columns representing color in place for every row of the data, we go through each row and assign the value 1 to the column representing the color present in our current row and fill in the other color columns of that row with a 0 to represent their absence
